unRAR license + GNU LGPL Notes
------------------------------

Please check main restriction from unRar license:

   2. The unRAR sources may be used in any software to handle RAR
      archives without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used
      to re-create the RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary.
      Distribution of modified unRAR sources in separate form or as a
      part of other software is permitted, provided that it is clearly
      stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
      not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.

In brief it means:
1) You can compile and use compiled files under GNU LGPL rules, since 
   unRAR license almost has no restrictions for compiled files.
   You can link these compiled files to LGPL programs.
2) You can fix bugs in source code and use compiled fixed version.
3) You can not use unRAR sources to re-create the RAR compression algorithm.


7zip\Compress\Rar29\Original folder contains files that are modified
versions of original unRAR source code files.

How to compile
--------------
To compile sources you need Visual C++ 6.0.
For compiling some files you also need 
new Platform SDK from Microsoft' Site:
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm
or
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/XPSP2FULLInstall.htm
or
http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/

If you use MSVC6, specify SDK directories at top of directories lists:
Tools / Options / Directories
  - Include files
  - Library files


To compile 7-Zip for AMD64 and IA64 you need:
  Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK from microsoft.com



Compiling under Unix/Linux
--------------------------
Check this site for Posix/Linux version:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/


Notes:
------
7-Zip consists of COM modules (DLL files).
But 7-Zip doesn't use standard COM interfaces for creating objects.
Look at
7zip\UI\Client7z folder for example of using DLL files of 7-Zip. 
Some DLL files can use other DLL files from 7-Zip.
If you don't like it, you must use standalone version of DLL.
To compile standalone version of DLL you must include all used parts
to project and define some defs. 
For example, 7zip\Bundles\Format7z is a standalone version  of 7z.dll 
that works with 7z format. So you can use such DLL in your project 
without additional DLL files.
