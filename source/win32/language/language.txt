Language Development Kit
------------------------

Edit and compile language.rc and resource.h into a DLL file. Name it <name_of_language>.nlg
and put it in the ./language folder relative to nestopia.exe. Once set, Nestopia will
automatically load it in on startup and make it selectable from the user interface.

A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 is available in the /projects folder.

Users who don't want to get their hands dirty with compilers can just use a simple resource
editor and modify the english.nlg file directly and save it under a different name. The
downside to that method however is that some useful resource information will not be present
in the DLL that's being edited.

Keep in mind that the language DLL files are not guaranteed to be compatible across different
versions of Nestopia so make use of the VERSION header and edit its fields with appropriate
data, e.g:

FileVersion + FILEVERSION: your own version
ProductVersion + PRODUCTVERSION: target version of Nestopia (1.32 at the time of this writing)
InternalName: language name

See english.nlg for an idea of how it should look. As for english.nlg itself, feedback to this
humble author regarding grammar and spelling misstakes are most appreciated.

Some strings in the resource table include a % (percent) sign which is intended to be replaced
by a runtime-string that can be anything ranging from file names to numbers and other things
not possible to deduce statically.

Example: "File % not found!" --> "Hajar i poolen? Ring %. Cinko cinko."

That's about it. Questions, suggestions and feedback to martin-freij at home.se.
