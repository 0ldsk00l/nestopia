Nestopia - Undead Edition
-------------------------

Nestopia has been abandoned for years. It's a great emulator,
and losing it would be a shame. The purpose of this project is to
keep Nestopia alive as long as possible and make sure it continues
to work on modern Linux distributions. In the future, Windows
builds may be maintained as well.

Enhancements will be made in an attempt to make this the best,
most user-friendly, standalone NES emulator on the Linux platform.
