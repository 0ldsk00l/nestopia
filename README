Nestopia - Undead Edition
-------------------------

Nestopia has been abandoned for years. It's a great emulator,
and losing it would be a shame. The purpose of this project is to
keep Nestopia alive as long as possible and make sure it continues
to work on modern operating systems.

Enhancements will be made in an attempt to make this the best,
most user-friendly, standalone NES emulator.

Future Goals:
- Linux port feature parity with Windows port
- libretro port
- Support for more mappers
- Pass more accuracy tests
